# I.  Sample based:
## 1. Missingness per sample
### Get some site missingness stats:
### Missingness rate (given as a fraction)
### Missingness counts (given as an integer)
### Plot Missingness per sample

## 2. Mean depth per sample
### Get some site depth stats:
### Mean depth per sample
### Plot depth per sample

## 3. Individual heterozygosity 
### Get some site depth stats:
### Plot heterozygosity per sample
### Individuals whose heterozygosity deviated more than 3 SD from the mean should be identified

## 4. Generate a file with the descriptive statistics per sample

## 5. Create a dataframe  with the samples that failed the autosome quality thresholds



# II. Site based:
## 1. Missingness per site

### b. Males (male.lmiss)
### Get some site missingness stats:
### Missingness rate (given as a fraction of samples missing the variant
### Missingness counts (given as an integer where N = samples x 2)
### Plot Missingness per site
### Missingness counts helps to see distribution

### 2. Mean depth per site
